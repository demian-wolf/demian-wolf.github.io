        Software development is an art.
        While writers create books and composers make music, software developers build websites, apps,
        and games without which we can't imagine our lives. I want others to dive into Software Development,
        feel it, and use it to make our world a better place. That's why I share my experience with people
        around the globe.

          I am a mentor at <a href="https://codeclub.org/" target="_blank">CodeClub</a>,
          an international non-profit organization that helps teenagers from 160+ countries
          worldwide learn to code.
        - |
          I started working at the <a href="https://codeclub.com.ua/" target="_blank">Ukrainian branch</a>
          of the organization two years ago, and became the
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CodeClubUA/posts/3223243804437926" target="_blank">youngest mentor</a>
          there.
        - |
          Since then, I've taught 40+ young people from different parts of the country. Not only did
          they acquire a solid knowledge of the basics of coding, but, what's more important, they got
          interested in programming, and many of them decided to link their future lives with it.
        - |
          I mentored different students. Some have written their first line of code with me, while
          others had prior programming experience and were looking for opportunities to boost their
          skills.
        - |
          I conduct weekly online lessons via Zoom, which last about 2 hours on average.
        - |
          To improve students' learning experience, I built an online LMS (learning management system).
          Now students have everything in one place, just one click away from them: from
          sending the homework and receiving the feedback to real-time chats with the mentor.
